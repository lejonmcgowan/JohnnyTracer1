simply run 

./run.sh [ARGS] 

to have cmake make and run the program. The image will be output in the same directory you called your input file argumetn in

In case the cmake build fails (chagning computers and the cache isn't cleared), clean up the cmake clutter by typing in 

./run.sh clean

then run the shell with the program parameters

Note that the Ray tracer relies on c++11, so it will not compile on gcc implementations that are older than 4.7
