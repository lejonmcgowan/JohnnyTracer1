Original learning of ray tracing for Cal Poly's CPE 473 course. Now abandoned for work on a more scalable version (see [JohnnyTracer2](https://github.com/lejonmcgowan/JohnnyTracer2))


simply run 

./run.sh [ARGS] 

to have cmake make and run the program. The image will be output in the same directory you called your input file argumetn in

In case the cmake build fails (chagning computers and the cache isn't cleared), clean up the cmake clutter by typing in 

./run.sh clean

then run the shell with the program parameters

Note that the Ray tracer relies on c++11, so it will not compile on gcc implementations that are older than 4.7

currently wonky/broken:

refractions are returning incorrect results
Schlick's approximation not yet implemented
GI is not yet implemented)
